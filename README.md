    popup.ShowCloseButton = true;
    popup.HeaderTitle = "";
    popup.PopupStyle.PopupBackground = Colors.Black;

    DataTemplate bodyTemplateView = new DataTemplate(() =>
    {
        var imageView = new Image();
        imageView.Source = e.Message?.Source;
        imageView.Margin = new Thickness(0, 0, 0, 20);
